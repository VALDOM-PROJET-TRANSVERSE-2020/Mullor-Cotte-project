            "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfiscal conservative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFace the Nation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscretionary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: \\xe2\\x80\\x98We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Democrats are saying that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or \\xe2\\x80\\x9centitlement reform,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, \\xe2\\x80\\x9centitlement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDreamers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need to do DACA clean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. '>)\n",
            "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study and will continue to defend the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat news.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not good for the military or our country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept \\xe2\\x80\\x9csome individuals who are not medically fit for service.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.

            "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b\"Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Mueller do his job'\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Graham said on CBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Face the Nation news program. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the right guy at the right time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing to be fair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. '>)\n",

The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign role, saying it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextremely limited\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office declined to comment. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in a statement.

Should be charging MUCH MORE!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates.

The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 doorsteps. Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel.

Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017.

            "tf.Tensor(b'As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfiscal conservative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFace the Nation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscretionary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: \\xe2\\x80\\x98We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Democrats are saying that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or \\xe2\\x80\\x9centitlement reform,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, \\xe2\\x80\\x9centitlement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDreamers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need to do DACA clean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. ', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study and will continue to defend the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat news.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not good for the military or our country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept \\xe2\\x80\\x9csome individuals who are not medically fit for service.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.

            "tf.Tensor(b\"Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Mueller do his job' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Graham said on CBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Face the Nation news program. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the right guy at the right time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing to be fair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \", shape=(), dtype=string)\n",

The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign role, saying it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextremely limited\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office declined to comment.

The president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties.

He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t.co/zrWpyMXRcz pic.twitter.com/wiQSQNNzw0  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017That snippet of code appears to be on all https://t.co/dkhw0AlHB4 pages, which the footer says is paid for by the RNC? pic.twitter.com/oaZDT126B3  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017It s also all over https://t.co/ayBlGmk65Z.

            "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b' Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump During His Christmas Speech Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int64, numpy=0>)\n"
